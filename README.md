# Deep-Learning
This repository includes the fundamentals of neural networks and then progress to state-of-the-art convolutional and recurrent neural networks as well as their use in applications for visual recognition.I have implemented and trained my own network for visual recognition tasks such as object recognition, image segmentation and caption generation.
