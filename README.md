# Deep-Learning

Neural networks are making a comeback!  Deep learning has taken over the machine learning community by storm, with success both in research and commercially.  Deep learning is applicable over a range of fields such as computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, robotics, etc.  This repository includes the fundamentals of neural networks and then progress to state-of-the-art convolutional and recurrent neural networks as well as their use in applications for visual recognition.I will implement and train my own network for visual recognition tasks such as object recognition, image segmentation and caption generation.
